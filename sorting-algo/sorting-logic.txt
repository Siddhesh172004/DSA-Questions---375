Bubble sort: Concept is that take the first element as smallest and then swap if the next index value is greator and do that till last and at last we get the largest number in the last index value
Then we take n-1 as the condition coz the last index value is biggest after every iteration so noo need to take that into consideration



Insertion sort: the concept is that we take second index value 
element and compare it with first preivous values and then do that if the after element is 
smaller then preivous then shift it to next or copy it to next index and do that till the element 
where it is to be inserted is also and next has same data then copy the temp into that pre+1 position as pre 
will be at the previou of the actual position
